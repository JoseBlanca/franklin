'''This module holds some utilities to build sequence cleaning pipelines.

Several pipelines are defined and they can be run using the function
_pipeline_builder. A pipeline consists of a list of several steps that a run
sequentially by the _pipeline_builder. It is very easy to create new pipeline
because they're just a list of dicts that include the name of a function. For
instance there are pipelines defined to clean short and long sequences, to
mask them using repeat masker, etc.

The pipeline can hold three step types: filter, mapper and bulk_processor. They
differ in the interface of the function that process the sequences:
    - mapper: These functions take a sequence and return a new processed
    sequence.
    - filter: These functions take a sequence and return True or False according
    to the match of some criteria by the sequence.
    - bulk_processor: These functions take a sequence iterator and return a new
    sequence iterator will the processed sequence.
The pipeline runner knows how to use these three kinds of steps to filter and
modify the sequences.

NGS workshop
============

The aim of this practical session is to introduce the analysis of the Next Generation Sequences (NGS) during a practical session. For each subject will be covered by a brief practical introduction and by a practical analysis. Take into account that this is a broad introduction and a lot of subtleties are not explained, because ngs_backbone takes care.

This workshop is aimed to people with experience on molecular genetics and genomics. A basic linux command line knowledge is also advisable.

Installation
============

clean_reads is a Python program, so you can install it as any other Python program.
Once that you have downloaded it::

  $ tar -xvzf clean_reads.tar.gz
  $ cd clean_reads
  $ python setup install

If you are not familiar with Python and you would like a more thorough explanation of the installation process you can refer to the `Installing Python Modules <http://docs.python.org/install/index.html>`_ chapter of the standard Python documentation or to the `Biopython install <http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/install/Installation.html>`_ documentation.

clean_reads depends in other two Python modules: Biopython_ and psubprocess_.

Biopython can be installed downloading it from the `Biopython install <http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/install/Installation.html>`_ page or from your distribution packages.

psubprocess_ is an optional requirement that will be used if you want to process your sequences in several parallel processes.
To install it just download it from its web page and do the `python setup install`.
